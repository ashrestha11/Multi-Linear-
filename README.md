# Multi-Linear-Car-Price-Prediction


The dataset was provided by https://www.kaggle.com/hellbuoy/car-price-prediction. The goal of this project was to apply the theory of multiple regression I learned from my Econometrics course at UCLA and use machine learning to predict the price output of a car with multiple independent variables.
