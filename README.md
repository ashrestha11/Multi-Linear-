Multi-linear regression to predict the car prices 

the dataset was provided by https://www.kaggle.com/hellbuoy/car-price-prediction. The goal of this project was to apply the theory of multiple regression I learned from my Econometrics course at UCLA and use machine learning to predict the price output of a car with multiple independent variables.
